	AX_CHECK_PCRE2: cosmetic change to fix the #serial number

2021-02-19  Michael Orlitzky  <michael@orlitzky.com>

	AX_ABSOLUTE_HEADER: replace AC_FOREACH with m4_foreach_w
	The AC_FOREACH macro is deprecated in favor of m4_foreach_w. This
	eliminates the associated warning in newer versions of autoconf.

	AX_PROG_CXX_FOR_BUILD: match changes made to AX_PROG_CC_FOR_BUILD recently
	- save/restore GXX
	- honor `./configure --build=BUILD`
	- use AC_LANG_PUSH and AC_LANG_POP to save and restore global variables
	  used for running tests like ac_compile and ac_link
	- use pushdef/popdef to save and restore ac_tool_prefix, cross_compiling
	  and am_cv_CXX_dependencies_compiler_type (not sure if we need the latter
	  but this mimicks what AX_PROG_CC_FOR_BUILD does)

	AX_LIB_HDF5: fix ax_lib_hdf5 on systems with verbose h5cc -show
	On some systems, the installation of h5cc is such that `h5cc -show` produces
	more than one line. This breaks the macro and produces an invalid Makefile.

	This proposed change just calls `head` before the call to `awk` to make sure
	only the first line (the relevant one) is used.

	AX_PTHREAD: use AS_ECHO instead of $as_echo
	AS_ECHO(["text"]) is the documented way to perform an 'echo' safely.
	$as_echo is an internal, undocumented shell variable that was part of
	the implementation of AS_ECHO; it was never intended to be used directly.

	The code in ax_pthread.m4 would work with autoconf 2.69, but with
	unreleased development versions of Autoconf from January 2013 until
	March 2020 (which did not set $as_echo at all) it would have malfunctioned
	unpredictably.  With versions after March 2020 it would work correctly
	but trigger -Wobsolete warnings.

2021-02-19  Jens Rehsack  <sno@netbsd.org>

	AX_PTHREAD: target > host
	Even if cross-compiling is not the most used use-case, it's much more
	important where we build for then where we run configure stage on (see
	autoconf-manual "18.6.3 Hosts and Cross-Compilation").

	AX_PTHREAD.M4: ensure C++ is handled analogous
	Since at least AIX behaves for CC_r/xlC_r as it does for cc_r/xlc_r and so on,
	use the same logic for CXX <-> PTHREAD_CXX as provided for CC <-> PTHREAD_CC
	to avoid code & issue duplication.

	ax_gcc_func_attribute.m4: test fails for the fallthrough attribute with clang
	The test for the fallthrough attribute fails due to other compiler
	warnings when using clang.  The following warnings are generated:

	   warning: no case matching constant switch condition '0'
	   warning: control reaches end of non-void function [-Wreturn-type]

	Because of these additional warnings, the test always results in a
	failure for the fallthrough attribute.

	Update ax_gcc_func_attribute.m4 to eliminate the warnings that are
	masking the test for the fallthrough attribute.

	Note, tested the entire suite of attribute tests using clang and only
	the fallthrough test contained warnings that caused the test to fail.

	ax_cxx_compile_stdcxx.m4: Restore check for default C++ version support
	Commit bbb60ca79952c20ee0b187208533d98206b156d1 removed this check because
	it can't support the user requesting noext.  But if the user didn't specify
	ext or noext, using the default mode should be fine.  So this patch restores
	the check if the second argument is empty.

	Hence, rename ax_cpu_vendor to ax_cv_cpu_vendor.

	ax_prog_cc_for_build.m4: bump serial to 18 (from 9)

	ax_prog_cc_for_build.m4: add call for AC_CANONICAL_BUILD

2020-02-08  Jannick  <thirdedition@gmx.net>

	ax_prog_cc_for_build.m4: use AC_LANG_PUSH([C]) and AC_LANG_POP([C])
	AC_LANG_PUSH([C]) makes sure that the global configure variables (like
	ac_ext, ac_cpp, ac_compile, ac_link, ac_compiler_gnu) required by the internal
	compile and link functions are defined for the C language for the BUILD
	system.  AC_LANG_POP([C]) ensures that the current language before calling
	AX_PROG_CC_FOR_BUILD is restored.

	AC_LANG_PUSH and AC_LANG_POP are preferable over manually defining the
	global ac_... language-related variables (incl. temporary SAVE variables).

	NOTE that any changes to the set of global variables, language specific variables
	(as defined by AC_LANG_PUSH([C]) and AC_LANG_POP([C])) shall be reflected
	in the pushdef/popdef blocks.

	ax_prog_cc_for_build.m4: bug fix - determine EXEEXT and OBJEXT for BUILD
	Prior to this commit, the variables ac_exeext and ac_objext remain undefined,
	however they are announced to be passed on to Makefile via the variables
	BUILD_EXEEXT and BUILD_OBJEXT.  For defining the former call the macros
	_AC_COMPILER_EXEEXT and _AC_COMPILER_OBJEXT using the BUILD compiler.

	NOTE: This commit makes use of the **internal** macros _AC_COMPILER_EXEEXT
	and _AC_COMPILER_OBJEXT, which, as of now, appears to be OK if EXEEXT and
	OBJEXT for the BUILD compiler should be determined with AX_PROG_CC_FOR_BUILD.

	ax_prog_cc_for_build.m4: bug fix - prevent using HOST cache values
	ax_prog_cc_for_build.m4: push&pop the following variables for BUILD

2020-02-08  Jannick  <thirdedition@gmx.net>

	ax_prog_cc_for_build.m4: bug fix - run tests with BUILD compiler
	Tested with autoconf 2.69: This is to fix that the compilation tests for
	BUILD use the HOST compiler, regardless of configure's --build flag.

	The compilation test functions in the configure script (like
	'ac_fn_c_try_compile' and 'ac_fn_c_try_cpp') use the global variables
	ac_ext, ac_cpp, ac_compile and ac_link.  Thus, the push&pop technique
	applied prior to this commit implies that the BUILD compilation test
	are run with the HOST compiler.
	Use an old-fashioned variable-save-technique.

2020-02-08  Jannick  <thirdedition@gmx.net>

	ax_prog_cc_for_build.m4: bug fix - honor configure's --build flag
	Prior to this commit, ./configure --build=BUILD is currently ignored, such
	that gcc found first on PATH is detected for BUILD, regardless of what
	was set in the parameter --build.

	This commit fixes this bug and allows to pass a BUILD platform triplet to
	configure which is different from gcc found first on PATH.

	* ax_prog_cc_for_build.m4:
	- use ac_build_tool_prefix defined to the first non-void variable of
	  'build' and 'build_alias' (push and pop).  Note that if configure is not
	  called with --build=BUILD, gcc first found on PATH is used for BUILD.

	Note that for GCC and Clang -pthread generally implies -lpthread, except when -nostdlib is passed.

	Changes:
	- added support for combination "cflags,ldflags" style option to try
	- check for Clang early
	- for GCC and Clang try "-pthread,-lpthread" first, followed by original options (-pthread, etc.)
	- Perform check for Clang flag to suppress warning when linking with -pthread later

	BUG FIX: Fixing a _R_CHECK_LENGTH_1_CONDITION_=true bug

	ax_cc_maxopt.m4: retain setting of CFLAGS by configure
	AX_CC_MAXOPT checks whether CFLAGS was set by the user; if so, the user’s
	setting is respected. This behavior is retained, of course.

	However, AX_CC_MAXOPT was then setting CFLAGS="". This overrode the default
	setting by configure, which usually includes -g. Hence, if CFLAGS was not
	set by the user, retain the default setting, to preserve the ability to
	debug.

	A typical default setting from configure is "-g -O2". This means that
	AX_CC_MAXOPT might typically set CFLAGS to "-g -O2 -O3". This is fine,
	because the later -O3 will override the earlier -O2. (The only assumption is
	that all compilers that AX_CC_MAXOPT knows behave in this sane way.)

	ax_cflags_warn_all.m4: Avoid prepending empty flags

2019-02-14  John Zaitseff  <J.Zaitseff@zap.org.au>

	ax_cflags_warn_all.m4: Prepend flags instead of appending them
	With many compilers (such as the Intel C compilers), flags specified
	later in the command line override those specified earlier.
	Unfortunately, this means that the user can no longer specify
	warning-related options on the command line.  This patch fixes this issue
	by using AX_PREPEND_FLAG.

	In particular, this patch allows the user to specify "CFLAGS=-w3" on the
	./configure command line for the Intel C compiler, which will no longer
	be overridden by this macro's "-w2" option.

	ax_prepend_flag.m4: New macro AX_PREPEND_FLAG
	The AX_PREPEND_FLAG macro adds a flag to the front of a flags shell
	variable, similar to how AX_APPEND_FLAG adds such flags to the end.  It
	should be used when adding compiler options that are position dependent:
	where those options that were previously defined (such as by the user on
	the command line) should override thoses added with AX_PREPEND_FLAG.

	ax_cflags_warn_all.m4: Rewrite AX_FLAGS_WARN_ALL to use AX_COMPILER_VENDOR
	Using AX_COMPILER_VENDOR allows significantly more robust selection of
	appropriate compiler flags.  In the old code, for example, the Sun
	(Oracle) Compiler Suite would accept Intel's "-warn all" detection, with
	rather disastrous results.

	All current compiler flags are incorporated into the new code without
	modification.

	xlc from version 16 on does neither define __xlc__, __xlC__, __IBMC__, nor

	It does define __ibmxl__, though. Adding this macro to the list of ibm macros

	ax_cxx_compile_stdcxx.m4: Drop the check for default C++ version support
	The problem with the check is that it can't detect whether the version
	is with extensions or not. So it can't take the "noext" or "ext"
	option into account.

	This may be a problem when an extended version of C++ has a feature
	that conflicts with another feature from the C++ standard and we have
	no way to tell the macro to add a "-std" flag anyway.

	An example:

	    using namespace std::complex_literals;
	    std::complex<double> c = 1.0;
	    c += 1.0i;
	    std::cout << "abs" << c << " = " << abs(c) << '\n';

	Here, the "1.0i" constant is either a GCC extension if compiled with
	-std=gnu++14 or a standard C++ operator if compiled with
	-std=c++14. If a GCC extension is used, the snippet fails to
	compile. Unfortunately, recent GCC versions default to gnu++14, so
	this code fails to compile by default.

	Dropping the check forces the macro to evaluate compiler flags with
	taking the "ext"/"noext" option into account.

	Issue spotted by Frédéric Mangano-Tarumi.

	AX_DIST_RPM: various fixes

	- Inserted make conditional so rules don't mess around in subdirectories.
	  Putting .spec files here via dist-hook breaks rpmbuild.

	- Run gawk with LC_ALL=C to produce english dates in RPMChangeLog understood by
	  rpmbuild.

	- Escape $PLATFORM_SUFFIX so variable given at configure time is used instead
	  of env variable present at the time aclocal is run.

	- Change .i. to just .. in rpm target. i* was probably meant to match i386 but
	  does not match x86_64.

	If there is any suggestions to improving this just let me know. The check for
	being at the top-level makefile seems a bit ugly but I can't come up with a
	better solution. Checking for MAKELEVEL == 0 doesn't work.

2017-08-15  Helmut Grohne  <helmut@subdivi.de>

	Fix crossbuild for AX_BOOST_BASE
	gource fails to cross build from source for wicked reasons. It
	terminates with:

	| Could not link against -lGLU !

	But that is a red herring. GLU is found. It just happens that ax_lib
	contains something old. The problem here is that BOOSTLIBDIR ends up
	being empty. It is derived from BOOST_LDFLAGS e.g. in AX_BOOST_SYSTEM or
	AX_BOOST_FILESYSTEM. Those latter macros expect that BOOST_LDFLAGS
	contains a -L flag. That flag goes missing during cross compilation. In
	AC_BOOST_BASE, the variable "libsubdirs" is properly set up to contain
	the multiarch libdir of the host architecture first. However, it is only
	searched for native compilation. For Debian systems, removing the cross
	compiling guard would likely resolve the issue. I'm less sure that this
	is universally correct though. Maybe a good solution would be to split
	"libsubdirs" into the multiarch directory (which would always be
	searched) and the others, which would only be searched for native
	compilation. I am attaching a patch for this approach.

	AX_PROG_HELP2MAN is a macro which helps using help2man to automatically

	AX_BOOST_BASE: Make tests more portable.
	This commit makes `test` calls in AX_BOOST_BASE more uniform.
	Comparisons with the empty string are replaced with the `-n` and `-z`
	arguments. Comparisons with non-empty strings are done in the common portable
	way (e.g. `test "x$succeesed" = "xyes"`). The fragile `-a` argument is
	replaced by `&&`.

2017-08-01  Nico Madysa  <nico.madysa@tu-dresden.de>

	AX_BOOST_BASE: Fix missing BOOST_LDFLAGS.
	AX_BOOST_BASE first checks if Boost is installed in a standard location
	and sets BOOST_CPPFLAGS and BOOST_LDFLAGS accordingly.

	If Boost cannot be found, these variables are reset. Further proceedings
	depend on whether the actual location was passed in via
	--with-boost=<path> or not. If it was, BOOST_CPPFLAGS is determined
	automatically based on the given path. This automatic detection, however, did
	not include BOOST_LDFLAGS.

	Consequently, if Boost is in a non-standard location that is given via
	--with-boost, the user would also have to specify --with-boost-libdir.

	This commit fixes this issue by also determining BOOST_LDFLAGS
	automatically in this particular branch of execution. The performed
	check is very similar to the one done in various other locations of the
	macro.

	AX_PYTHON_DEVEL: Swap values of PYTHON_EXTRA_LIBS, PYTHON_EXTRA_LDFLAGS
	The LIBS and SYSLIBS Python configuration variables are lists of
	libraries, with typical values (on Debian GNU/Linux) being

	    LIBS = -lpthread -ldl -lutil
	    SYSLIBS = -lm

	so they should clearly be in a LIBS variable, not LDFLAGS.
	Conversely, the LINKFORSHARED Python configuration variable contains
	miscellaneous linker options, with its value on Debian being

	    -Xlinker -export-dynamic -Wl,-O1 -Wl,-Bsymbolic-functions

	so it should be in the LDFLAGS.

	This matters when linking statically or using a particularly
	pedantic linker: LDFLAGS appear on the linker command-line before
	the object files to be linked and (with some linkers) cannot satisfy
	undefined symbols, whereas LIBS appear after the object files in
	dependency order.

	AX_SUBDIRS_CONFIGURE: new macro
	AX_SUBDIRS_CONFIGURE is a macro akin to AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS which allows
	to run other configure scripts. AX_SUBDIRS_CONFIGURE attempts to follow
	the same rules as AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS such as:

	- command line arguments from the parent configure script are given to
	  the child configure script.
	- some arguments are modified (for instance `--cache-file`, `--srcdir`)

	However, as opposed to AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS, AX_SUBDIRS_CONFIGURE takes 4
	additional parameters which correspond to:

	- arguments that must always be passed down to child configure scripts.
	- arguments that may be merged with existing arguments.
	- arguments that must replace existing arguments.
	- arguments that must never be passed to the configure scripts.

	Subdirectories recorded with AX_SUBDIRS_CONFIGURE are added to the new
	`subdirs_extra` variable instead of `subdirs`.

	ax_valgrind_check: Don't eat check-valgrind errors
	Currently, after running 'make check-valgrind', $? will always be 0 even

	gets in the way of using 'make check-valgrind' during CI.

	This commit switches from using make -k on each individual target to
	running make -k on all the targets at once. This way, we will run the

	ax_code_coverage: avoid GNU Make extensions
	ifeq/ifneq is a GNU Make extension which doesn't work with BSD Make and
	others, resulting in errors such as:

	    Missing dependency operator
	    Need an operator
	    warning: duplicate script for target "ifeq" ignored

	Although it would be preferable to use the Automake conditionals
	(AM_CONDITIONAL) in the make rules, this does not appear to be possible
	within AC_SUBST content.  Instead, build the rules using shell variable
	concatenation and only AC_SUBST the ones which should be used.

	ax_compiler_flags_*: fix underquoting causing infinite recursion
	These macros would fail with infinite recursion if used twice for the
	same variable, for example

	    AX_COMPILER_FLAGS_CFLAGS([WARN_CFLAGS], ... some options ...)
	    AX_COMPILER_FLAGS_CFLAGS([WARN_CFLAGS], ... more options ...)

	In particular, invoking AX_COMPILER_FLAGS, followed by
	AX_COMPILER_FLAGS_CFLAGS with more "yes" options has this failure mode.

	This is because the first time through the macro, we define
	ax_warn_cflags_variable = "WARN_CFLAGS" as expected. The second time,
	because the first parameter is underquoted, its value is substituted
	before calling m4_define, so we inadvertently define
	WARN_CFLAGS = "WARN_CFLAGS". The next time WARN_CFLAGS is mentioned,
	attempts to expand it will recurse forever, because m4 does not
	special-case a macro that appears in its own expansion like cpp does.

	AX_OPEN62541_PATH: set AM_DISTCHECK_CONFIGURE_FLAGS
	When configuring --with-open62541=<path>, the make distcheck target
	often failed because the open62541 library was not found on the system.

	So set the AM_DISTCHECK_CONFIGURE_FLAGS variable with the required
	values (absolute paths in case the user defined relative paths).

2016-06-24  Olaf Mandel  <olaf@mandel.name>

	AX_OPEN62541_PATH: fix use of non-inst shared lib
	If the open62541 library is not installed and the shared library is to
	be used, the --with-open62541=<path> option to contigure setting
	CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS is not enough: other checks by configure may
	compile test binaries with the library linked in and then try to execute
	then. The execution fails because of the not found shared library object
	and gives a wrong test result. Likewise, some make targets (like check)
	need to execute compiled binaries.

	So modify AX_OPEN62541_PATH() so it exports LD_LIBRARY_PATH with the
	absolute path of the build dir for the rest of the configure script to
	use and define a Makefile variable OPEN62541_LDPATH, which contains
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<abs_path_to_build>.

	AX_CHECK_OPEN62541_LIB() -> AX_OPEN62541_CHECK_LIB()

	And add the new AX_OPEN62541_PATH(), which containes the shared
	functionality previously handled by both old AX_CHECK_* macros.

	Also add a forgotten feature promissed in the documentation: the
	--with-open62541-shared and --with-open62541-static options can be
	used to change the order in which the libraries are searched for.

	AX_VALGRIND_CHECK: support silent rules
	Use the standard autoconf $(V) variable to conditionally hide the

	Hide the outer list of commands in check-valgrind completely with
	$(AM_V_at) and define a new $(valgrind_v_use) for the individual
	check-valgrind-* calls. The $(valgrind_v_use) call writes:

	  USE    $(patsubst check-valgrind-%,%,$@):

	Note that this only works inside rules of the form check-valgrind-* .

2016-03-09  dryman  <idryman@gmail.com>

	Improved three opengl autoconf macros
	Main features added:
	- Support action-if-found and not-found hook
	- Export HAVE_GL, HAVE_GLU, and HAVE_GLUT preprocessor symbol
	- Add necessary flags to CFLAGS/LIBS by default, but can be disabled by
	  overwritting action-if-found hook.
	- Fail the configure script if lib not found. This feature can be disabled by
	  overwritting action-if-not-found hook
	- Fix problems on Mac OSX. Been tested on Linux (Ubuntu) and OSX
	- Use --with-xquartz-gl instead of --with-gl=x for using X11 on OSX

	Two new macros added:
	- ax_save_flags_with_prefix.m4: save flags and pushes flag with prefix to the
	  flag.
	  AX_SAVE_FLAGS_WITH_PREFIX([GL],[[CFLAGS],[LIBS]]) would expands to
	    gl_saved_flag_cflags="$CFLAGS"
	    gl_saved_flag_libs="$LIBS"
	    CFLAGS="$GL_CFLAGS $CFLAGS"

	AX_VALGRIND_CHECK: fix logic around AC_CHECK_PROG
	There are two problems in the logic around the first AC_CHECK_PROG()
	call:

	1. If AC_CHECK_PROG() fails to find valgrind, with neither configure
	   option --enable-valgrind nor --disable-valgrind, then the
	   enable_valgrind variable ends up being set incorrectly to yes.

	2. If configure was started with --disable-valgrind, then there is no need
	   to run AC_CHECK_PROG() at all.

2016-03-03  Olaf Mandel  <olaf@mandel.name>

	AX_VALGRIND_CHECK: clean up configure message
	When running configure, the displayed text contained two interleaved
	messages. Got:

	checking whether to enable Valgrind on the unit tests... checking for valgrind... valgrind
	yes

	instead of the probably intended:

	checking whether to enable Valgrind on the unit tests... yes
	checking for valgrind... valgrind

	In addition, the first message seems to convey no additional information
	compared to the second message: if valgrind is not found (and there is no
	--enable-valgrind error), then the result of the check is "no" as
	displayed for the executable check. And in all other cases, the result is
	"yes". So remove the first message completely: this takes care of the
	mangled status messages.

	AX_CXX_COMPILE_STDCXX: don't break "make CXXFLAGS=..."
	Make C++ std-selection macros modify $(CXX), not $(CXXFLAGS).

	Using $(CXXFLAGS) prevents users from being able to
	rebuild with different CXXFLAGS (e.g.: to try out
	different optimisations or to change debug levels)
	unless they re-run ./configure with their CFLAGS.

	This is more like what the mainline Autoconf macros do
	(e.g.: AC_PROG_CC_C99, AC_PROG_CC_STD, etc. modify $(CC),
	not $(CCFLAGS)), presmuably for much the same reasons:
	if you need to specify a standard to the compiler,
	it doesn't really make sense to separate that from
	$(CC)/$(CXX) since $(CC)/$(CXX) aren't usable without it.

	Needs to either call $(subst ) for each undesired character or

	individually. Currently only strips dots and dashes, but these

	AX_CODE_COVERAGE: add BRANCH_COVERAGE variable
	Add a new CODE_COVERAGE_BRANCH_COVERAGE variable that can be used
	to provide --rc lcov_branch_coverage=[01] options to lcov and
	--rc genhtml_branch_coverage=[01] options to genhtml. These may be
	desirable to the user since the default for branch coverage changed
	in some "recent" lcov version.

	This is achieved by adding a LCOV_SHOPTS variable (for SHared
	OPTionS) to the default LCOV_OPTIONS one. And the filtering call of
	lcov gets a symmetric LCOV_RMOPTS variable (which is currently
	empty).

	In addition, ensure that all LCOV_{SHOPTS,OPTIONS,RMOPTS} and
	GENHTML_OPTIONS have a corresponding _DEFAULT variable: this became
	desirable here because of the new defaults for LCOV_SHOPTS and
	GENHTML_OPTIONS; the LCOV_RMOPTS_DEFAULT is there only for
	symmetry.

	Fix second pass bug in _AX_WITH_CURSES_CHECKEXTRA
	Found bug where when _AX_WITH_CURSES_CHECKEXTRA is called a second time
	on the same library, e.g. ncurses, the previous setting of
	_AX_WITH_CURSES_CHECKEXTRA_cv_var to 'yes' would be changed to 'no' just
	due to the tested header file not being available on the second pass.

	This was found when AX_WITH_CURSES has 'with_ncurses' set to 'yes' and
	'with_ncursesw' set to 'no' forcing _AX_WITH_CURSES_CHECKEXTRA to be
	called twice in succession since ax_cv_curses_which is set to 'ncurses'
	and the panel.h header file is tested as ncurses/panel.h and panel.h.

	The system in question is OpenSuSE LEAP 42.1 which installs
	/usr/include/ncurses/panel.h and not /usr/include/panel.h.

	AX_BOOST_PYTHON: Update for the AX_PYTHON_DEVEL change.
	Because AX_PYTHON_DEVEL now provides PYTHON_LIBS instead of PYTHON_FLAGS,
	this script needs to be updated accordingly.
	This lets AX_BOOST_PYTHON actually find the boost python library
	on newer systems that ignore the -l flags if they appear before the
	source file on the command line.

	I'm not sure why I needed to add PYTHON_LIBS to LIBS in the AC_CACHE_CHECK()
	line, though it apparently wasn't necessary to use PYTHON_LDFLAGS there
	before. I suspect that much of this file doesn't really make sense.

	AX_APPEND_COMPILE_FLAGS, AX_APPEND_LINK_FLAGS: Optional INPUT arg
	Behaves exactly like the optional INPUT argument of
	AX_CHECK_COMPILE_FLAG, AX_CHECK_LINK_FLAG.

	Motivation: I'd like to add -fstack-protector-strong.  The obvious
	solution is AX_APPEND_COMPILE_FLAGS([-fstack-protector-strong]).

	Unfortunately, some ports of the GNU toolchain reportedly pass this
	test, then fail to link.  That's because the compiler accepts the
	flag, duly emits references to helper code in libc (on my system:
	___stack_chk_guard()), but libc doesn't provide, and linking fails.

	The new argument lets me cover this failure mode:

	    AX_APPEND_LINK_FLAGS([-fstack-protector-strong], [], [],
	        [AC_LANG_SOURCE([[
	    int
	    main(int argc, char *argv[])
	    {
	        char arr[64], *dst = arr, *src = argv[0];
	        while ((*dst++ = *src++)) ;
	    }
	        ]])])

	Unify macros for checking C++11/14/... compiler support.
	* m4/ax_cxx_compile_stdcxx.m4: New macro file added.

	(AX_CXX_COMPILE_STDCXX): New macro added.  The code is based on
	the former (serial version number 13) `AX_CXX_COMPILE_STDCXX_11`
	macro, generalized to check for arbitrary versions of the standard
	selected via an additional argument.

	(_AX_CXX_COMPILE_STDCXX_testbody_11): New internal macro added.
	Defined in terms of `_AX_CXX_COMPILE_STDCXX_testbody_new_in_11`.

	(_AX_CXX_COMPILE_STDCXX_testbody_14): New internal macro added.
	Defined in terms of `_AX_CXX_COMPILE_STDCXX_testbody_new_in_11`
	and `_AX_CXX_COMPILE_STDCXX_testbody_new_in_14`.

	(_AX_CXX_COMPILE_STDCXX_testbody_new_in_11): New internal macro
	added.  Test code to check for features added in C++14.  It is
	based on the code previously found in the
	`_AX_CXX_COMPILE_STDCXX_11_testbody` macro, defined in
	`m4/ax_cxx_compile_stdcxx_11.m4` but heavily refactored and
	extended with additional checks.

	(_AX_CXX_COMPILE_STDCXX_testbody_new_in_14): New internal macro
	added.  Test code to check for features added in C++14.

	* m4/ax_cxx_compile_stdcxx_11.m4:

	(AX_CXX_COMPILE_STDCXX_11): Make this macro an alias for the new
	`AX_CXX_COMPILE_STDCXX` macro with the version set to C++11.

	(_AX_CXX_COMPILE_STDCXX_11_testbody): Internal macro deleted.

	* m4/ax_cxx_compile_stdcxx_14.m4: New macro file added.

	(AX_CXX_COMPILE_STDCXX_14): New macro added.  This macro is an
	alias for the new `AX_CXX_COMPILE_STDCXX` macro with the version
	set to C++14.

	* m4/ax_cxx_compile_stdcxx_0x.m4 (AX_CXX_COMPILE_STDCXX_0X): Mark
	macro as obsolete.  The macro `AX_CXX_COMPILE_STDCXX_11` should be
	used instead.  I couldn't test this macro on my system because it
	uses a lot of obsolete macros my Autoconf complains about and
	errors out.

2015-11-23  Olaf Mandel  <olaf@mandel.name>

	AX_PROG_DOXYGEN: allow AC_CONFIG_FILES([Doxyfile])
	To allow substitutions in the used Doxyfile, two changes are needed:

	1. also substitute everything put in the environment (except DOCDIR)
	2. allow Doxyfiles to also reside in the builddir

	The latter change is a potentially breaking one! The old behaviour was
	to always prefix $(srcdir)/ to the location provided as the second
	(and forth, sixth, ...) parameter. This needs to be dropped to allow
	for searching in the build directory. To compensate, the default now
	is $(srcdir)/Doxyfile.

	So the following still works:

	DX_INIT_DOXYGEN([foo])
	DX_INIT_DOXYGEN([foo], , [dest-dir])

	While this needs to be changed:
	   DX_INIT_DOXYGEN([foo], [Doxyfile])
	-> DX_INIT_DOXYGEN([foo], [$(srcdir)/Doxyfile])

2015-11-23  Olaf Mandel  <olaf@mandel.name>

	AX_PROG_DOXYGEN: support multiple Doxyfiles
	Allow the DX_INIT_DOXYGEN() macro to take more than one Doxyfile
	and/or output-directory argument. This may be of interest e.g. for
	both public and internal documentation.

	This keeps as much backwards-compatibility as possible: of the
	preexisting variables, only DX_ENV is changed slightly (removed
	DOCDIR).

2015-11-23  Olaf Mandel  <olaf@mandel.name>

	AX_PROG_DOXYGEN: fix doxygen-ps rule
	In the rule for $(PACKAGE).ps depended on by doxygen-ps the
	undefined variable MAKEINDEX_PATH was used instead of the correct
	variable DX_MAKEINDEX. Fixed.

	AX_PROG_DOXYGEN: add support for silent rules
	Any warnings of Doxygen are much easier to see if there are not
	several lines of commands interspersed.

2015-11-23  Olaf Mandel  <olaf@mandel.name>

	AX_PROG_DOXYGEN: provide a DX_RULES substitution
	Convert the previously provided aminclude.am snippet in the
	documentation into a AC_SUBST substitution. This allows for easy
	upgrades to the DX_INIT_DOXYGEN macro without the user having to
	manually update the corresponding section of their Makefile.am.

	As autoconf substitutions are not recursive, also convert all
	@DX_DOCDIR@ and @PACKAGE@ substitutions in the snippet to using
	variables. And as AM_CONDITIONAL also relies on substitution,
	remove all AM_CONDITIONAL calls and instead use a separate
	variable for each of the sections previously enclosed in an if-block.

2015-11-23  Emil Mikulic  <emikulic@gmail.com>

	Add 1.12 to list of lcov versions.

2015-10-13  Olaf Mandel  <olaf@mandel.name>

	AX_CODE_COVERAGE: add CPPFLAGS to skip assertions
	The assert() statement is a very helpful tool for quality assurance
	in nearly every kind of software project. But during code coverage
	it unnecessarily decreases the branch coverage percentage as
	assertions should never fail. This is probably not what the user
	expects as the branch contained inside the assert() statement is not
	visible in the code.

	So in a workflow where first the "check" target is run to see if any
	test fails (e.g. because of a failing assertion) and then the code
	coverage is consulted to see how much of the code was exercised, the
	assertions should not be counted.

	Implement this by adding a variable CODE_COVERAGE_CPPFLAGS which is
	defined to -DNDEBUG if CODE_COVERAGE_ENABLED.

2015-10-10  Olaf Mandel  <olaf@mandel.name>

	AX_CODE_COVERAGE: further silence rules for V=0
	Expand on the pre-existing code_coverage_quiet variables that add

	Completely silence builds for V=0:
	 * hide the two "outer" make invokations of check-code-coverage
	 * display short replacement texts for the three commands inside of
	   code-coverage-capture

2015-10-01  Elliott Sales de Andrade  <quantum.analyst@gmail.com>

	Push C language before testing HDF5 libraries.

2015-09-25  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	AX_PYTHON_DEVEL: provide PYTHON_LIBS, not PYTHON_LDFLAGS
	Because -L and -l are LIBS arguments, not LDFLAGS arguments.
	Calling it PYTHON_LDFLAGS suggested wrongly that they should be
	used in LDFLAGS, which can cause the -L and -l arguments to
	be ignored when they are not in the expected position in the list
	of command line arguments. This is a problem, for instance,
	with the command line generated by AC_LINK_IFELSE.

	ax_compiler_flags: Eliminate ‘minimum’ and ‘maximum’ warning levels
	These went against the whole concept of providing a baseline set of
	warnings which is set by the module maintainer, since it allowed
	individual developers to opt out of certain classes of warning.

	Remove them, leaving the ‘no’, ‘yes’ and ‘error’ levels. This maintains
	API compatibility of the macros by marking various EXTRA-* variables as
	unused, but still handling them, and merging their values with the
	preceding EXTRA-* variables. For example, all extra ‘maximum’ and
	‘error’ flags are now included in the ‘yes’ level of warnings.

	ax_compiler_flags: Clarify the EXTRA-* variables are for warnings only

2015-02-23  Philip Withnall  <philip.withnall@collabora.co.uk>

	ax_compiler_flags: Automate addition of -Wno-error=* flags
	We need to add a -Wno-error=* flag for each -Wno-* flag as some
	compilers will re-enable the warning as an error if -Wall is passed in
	the user’s CFLAGS after we’ve specific -Werror.

	Previously this was done manually for the -Wno-* flags in
	AX_COMPILER_FLAGS_CFLAGS and AX_COMPILER_FLAGS_CXXFLAGS. However, this
	ignored the cases where the user was passing -Wno-* flags as extra-flags
	to the macros.

	Factor this out and automate it so -Wno-error=* flags will be tested and
	appended for any -Wno-* flag specified by the user in extra-flags.

2015-02-23  Philip Withnall  <philip.withnall@collabora.co.uk>

	ax_compiler_flags_cflags: Remove -Waggregate-return
	Historically, this flag has been used because certain old C compilers
	didn’t support it — that’s not really relevant any more. It was also
	used to warn the developer about the potential for overflowing the
	stack. However, I believe the benefits of being able to pass small
	structures (e.g. a GdkRectangle) by value outweights the likelihood of
	putting a huge structure on the stack and overflowing it.

	Within GNOME, a coding standard exists to not return aggregates by value
	because it is hard to generate introspected bindings for such code.
	g-ir-scanner should warn about this instead.

	ax_compiler_flags: Only check for C++ if AC_PROG_CXX is called
	The previous behavior of the macro was to use a C compiler, but when C++
	support was added, it created an unconditional dependency on a C++
	compiler. This is undesirable for most C projects, and slows down
	configure considerably by adding unnecessary checks.

	Add an internal _AX_COMPILER_FLAGS_LANG macro, with the desired language
	as the first argument. Only require the macro for the corresponding
	compiler warning flags if AC_PROG_lang has been called. Enable C support
	by default.

	AX_APPEND_FLAG: fix regression
	AX_APPEND_FLAG has changed behaviour compared to earlier versions: it
	adds the FLAG also when the variable contains FLAG. I traced down the
	altered behaviour to the two lines

	 [case " AS_VAR_GET(FLAGS) " in
	    *" $1 "*)

	which have changed to

	  AS_CASE([AS_VAR_GET(FLAGS)],
	    ["* $1 *|*$1"]

	besides that AS_CASE is used (which is good imho) the pattern has
	changed and the space around FLAGS in the first argument of AS_CASE has
	gone. This means that e.g. if FLAGS is "alpha beta gamma" that will not
	match the pattern "* $1 *|*$1" for $1 being any of 'alpha', 'beta', or
	'gamma'. I think that is unexpected behaviour.

	This patch restores the original semantics.

	WARN_CXXFLAGS. Pass the EXTRA-*-CFLAGS variables to

	--enable-compile-warnings would be useful.

2015-01-26  Philip Withnall  <philip.withnall@collabora.co.uk>

	ax_compiler_flags: Split out into separate macros per tool
	Unfortunately, the API for AX_COMPILER_FLAGS does not scale for more
	than two tools, due to the number of parameters required.

	Without breaking API, split AX_COMPILER_FLAGS out into:
	 • AX_COMPILER_FLAGS_CFLAGS
	 • AX_COMPILER_FLAGS_LDFLAGS
	and use both of these in the implementation of AX_COMPILER_FLAGS.

	This means that support for a new tool can be implemented as a separate
	macro, and used inside AX_COMPILER_FLAGS if deemed necessary, without
	necessarily needing to add new EXTRA-* parameters for it — if people
	want to add extra parameters for the tool, they can invoke
	AX_COMPILER_FLAGS_* manually.

	3) Removed a white space between the "-L" and the directory for

	4) The "action-found" and "action-not-found" logic was incorrect.

	AX_LIB_HDF5: add support for recognizing HDF5 built with ccache
	The ax_lib_hdf5.m4 autoconf macro uses awk to determine which compiler was used
	to build HDF5. This fails if HDF5 was built using ccache because "ccache" is
	then used as HDF5_CC instead of the actual compiler wrapped by ccache. The
	attached patch fixes that.

	AX_EXECINFO: new macro to test execinfo size type
	<execinfo.h> has been available on a number of systems now, but unfortunately
	different systems use different types to represent the size of the backtrace,
	with netBSD and FreeBSD using size_t and Linux, Mac OS X. To build calls that
	work with both implementations without warning, this macro not only checks if
	the execinfo header is available but also what type is used for the len
	argument of backtrace_symbols and the return value of backtrace.

	All in all this macro defines

	    HAVE_EXECINFO_H if execinfo.h can be included,
	    backtrace_size_t to the len argument type, i.e. int or size_t,
	    HAVE_BACKTRACE to 1 if the function can be linked to,

	and append any library needed to LIBS (e.g. some BSD's need -lexecinfo).

	M4sugar and M4sh added to AX_PROG_JAR, AX_PROG_JAVA, AX_PROG_JAVAC, and AX_PROG_JAVADOC. Also fixed a path discrepancy with AX_JAVA_OPTIONS.
	The discrepancy is AX_JAVA_OPTIONS sets up a variable JAVAPREFIX
	which is described to the user as the "prefix where the Java runtime
	is installed".  Unfortunately, that directory doesn't contain any
	executables, but $JAVAPREFIX/bin does.

	This incorrect path was passed in the value-if-not-found parameter
	of AC_CHECK_PROGS which is incorrect.  I fixed the path and pass it
	in to the path parameter.

	AX_EXT: determine if the OS actually supports AVX
	AX_EXT checks for different SIMD variants on a CPU. It checks for AVX, but
	doesn't go far enough to actually be useful in some cases. It is possible to be
	on a CPU with AVX support and the OS doesn't support it. We should be checking
	that such support exists. This is via an additional check of cpuinfo's ECX
	register bit 27. Then one needs to call xgetbv and if EAX&0b110 = 0b110 then
	AVX is supported by the CPU and OS.

2013-03-29  Roy Stogner  <roystgnr@ices.utexas.edu>

	AX_CXX_COMPILE_STDCXX_11: test code now includes the "auto" keyword
	Furthermore, the macro now uses AC_LANG_PUSH/POP rather than AC_LANG_ASSERT,
	which makes it more robust to use.

	An optional second argument makes it possible to test for C++11 and return the
	result with an AC_DEFINE/AC_SUBST/AM_CONDITIONAL without erroring out if
	support is not found.

	This new version should be nearly backwards-compatible with the old; the
	obvious exception being when compilers which implement a subset of C++11 not
	including "auto" are used with codes for which that subset would have been
	sufficient.

	Further details can be found at <http://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?7985>.

	AX_OPENMP: fix Mac OS X support
	The macro was failing to detect the OpenMP flags for g++ on Mac OS 10.7 because

	    "_gomp_thread_attr", referenced from:
	        _initialize_env in libgomp.a(env.o)
	  ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64
	  collect2: ld returned 1 exit status

	As explained at [1], without resorting to a non-portable hack, the test program
	needs to actually use an OMP pragma.

	AX_PROG_CXX_FOR_BUILD: Initial version
	Add an AX_PROG_CXX_FOR_BUILD macro based on AX_PROG_CC_FOR_BUILD that
	tries to detect the C++ compiler to use for the build host when cross-
	compiling.

2013-01-04  Thierry Reding  <thierry.reding@avionic-design.de>

	Unbreak AX_PROG_CC_FOR_BUILD
	Instead of pushing the cross_compiling and ac_tool_prefix definitions,
	override them by assignment. Pushing the definition will cause the
	variable names to be replaced instead of the content.

	While at it, remove the AC_TRY_COMPILER redefinition as it was removed
	in autoconf 2.50. Also push LDFLAGS to prevent flags specific to the
	host tools from leaking into the build tools. Furthermore, consistently
	pop definitions in the reverse order than they were pushed.

2012-09-07  Christopher Gilbreth  <cngilbreth@gmail.com>

	AX_BLAS: improve the detection of the Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL)
	New versions of the MKL cannot be linked with "-lmkl -lguide -lpthread", but
	instead require variations on "-lmkl_intel_lp64 -lmkl_sequential -lmkl_core
	-lpthread",depending on architecture, compiler & other variables. See
	<http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-mkl-link-line-advisor/>.

	The present patch detects the architecture (x86_64 or i686) and compiler
	(gfortran or others), but not the interface layer (assumes lp64 for x86_64),
	threading (assumes sequential), static vs. dynamic (assumes dynamic), etc.

	Tested on a number of different systems using gfortran and ifort.

	See <http://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?7807> for further details.

	AX_CHECK_POSTGRES_DB: version bump and cosmetic

2012-09-07  Olivier Mehani  <olivier.mehani@nicta.com.au>

	Add -Idir to CPPFLAGS rather than CFLAGS

2012-09-07  Olivier Mehani  <olivier.mehani@nicta.com.au>

	Substantial rewrite of AX_CHECK_POSTGRES_DB.
	It still behaves the same by default, AC_DEFINing HAVE_LIBPQ and setting
	variables PQINCPATH and PQLIBPATH, while erroring when either header or
	library is found in the default or specified paths.

	The logic is however different, where the specified prefixes and/or
	incdir and libdir are temporarily added to CFLAGS and LDFLAGS. The
	normal detection logic (AC_CHECK_HEADER and AC_CHECK_LIB) is used next,
	only, and once.

	In addition, two optional arguments to the macro, ACTION-IF-FOUND and
	ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND are now available to extend the logic. The default
	ACTION-IF-FOUND is to do nothing (apart from defining the variables and
	substitutions, which is always done). The default ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND is
	to error out; it is replaced by the ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND if specified
	to, e.g., gracefully remove configure PGSQL out when it's only optional.

	Bump serial from 5 to 6.

2012-07-22  Diego Elio Pettenò  <flameeyes@flameeyes.eu>

	AX_BOOST_SYSTEM, AX_BOOST_FILESYSTEM: inverse the order of search for libraries
	With the original macros, the oldest versioned library is used, but
	for most distribution this is detrimental, as the old versions are
	kept for compatibility, and not to be linked against. By using tac we
	reverse the order of the libraries, preferring an unversioned one
	(usually the latest available on the system), and then proceeding in
	descending order.

	Together with this, also try to simplify the sed syntax. It's of note
	that even though tac might not be very portable, the sed syntax used
	is also not so portable, so it might be worth working this around in a
	different way.

	AX_CHECK_ZLIB: cosmetic indentation fix
	Adding some quoting and replacing "test x -a y" with more portable
	"test x && test y".

	AX_CHECK_ZLIB: change the behavior so macro proceeds to compile and link tests even if zlib.h was not found in the "usual locations". If end-user has provided CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS as needed for compilation/linking to succeed, there is no reason to error out.

	AX_CHECK_ZLIB: fix help output so it is inline with other macros that uses AS_HELP_STRING.

	AX_CHECK_ZLIB: extend the interface to the typical ([action-if-found], [action-if-not-found])-style, so user can define how macro should behave when macro is successful or failed. If not provided the macro will behave as previously. I also clarified in DESCRIPTION what this behaviour is.

	AX_CHECK_ZLIB: the current version only looks for zlib if --with-zlib was provided [by user]. This patch changes that so the search and test are also performed in default mode.

2012-06-18  Mike Frysinger  <vapier@gentoo.org>

	AC_REQUIRE AX_APPEND_FLAG when appropriate.
	A bunch of m4 files use AX_APPEND_FLAG, but don't AC_REQUIRE, which

	AX_CXX_COMPILE_STDCXX_11: new submission
	This is a revised version of AX_CXX_COMPILE_STDCXX_0X. The major changes
	are:

	 - Automatically sets CXXFLAGS to enable support for C++11, and errors out if
	   no C++11 mode can be found. (Note: currently only supports GCC-style -std=
	   switches.) Does not define any preprocessor macros.

	 - Support for other compilers' mode switches will be much easier to add.

	 - Can be instructed to avoid using C++11-with-extensions compilation modes, or
	   C++11-without-extensions modes, as appropriate.

	 - Autoupdate clean.

	 - Better AC_MSG_CHECKING messages.

	 - Consistently refers to C++11 rather than C++0x.

	AX_PROG_DOXYGEN: cleaned up use of AM_CONDITIONAL
	Previously, calls to AM_CONDITIONAL were inside shell flow control
	structures. The automake manual notes that running AM_CONDITIONAL
	conditionally will confuse automake. In this case, later use of the
	AM_COND_IF to check if Doxygen was found would result in the
	conditional appearing to be false, even if it's not.

	AX_PTHREAD: fixed mis-placed brackets

2011-08-01  Chun-Chung Chen  <cjj@u.washington.edu>

	AX_LIB_HDF5: HAVE_HDF5 was defined even when the library is not detected
	The following codes are executed unless --without-hdf5 is used, even
	when the HDF5 library is not installed or detected:

	  AC_SUBST([HDF5_VERSION])
	  AC_SUBST([HDF5_CFLAGS])
	  AC_SUBST([HDF5_CPPFLAGS])
	  AC_SUBST([HDF5_LDFLAGS])
	  AC_SUBST([HDF5_FFLAGS])
	  AC_SUBST([HDF5_FLIBS])
	  AC_DEFINE([HAVE_HDF5], [1], [Defined if you have HDF5 support])

	To remedy the situation, these have been moved into the conditional
	block where HDF5 is actually detected.

	AX_PTHREAD: fixed Autoconf warnings about underquoted arguments

2011-07-30  Peter Simons  <simons@cryp.to>

	AX_GCC_INSTALL_DIR, AX_GCC_LIBRARIES_DIR, AX_GCC_VERSION, and AX_GXX_VERSION are non-functional and have been marked obsolete, because they depend on the obsolete AX_GCC_OPTION macro, which has been removed from the archive.

2011-07-28  John Zaitseff  <J.Zaitseff@zap.org.au>

	AX_WITH_CURSES: major re-write
	I re-wrote the AX_WITH_CURSES macro, and added the macros AX_WITH_CURSES_PANEL,
	AX_WITH_CURSES_MENU, and AX_WITH_CURSES_FORM for the following reasons:

	 - The checks are far more rigorous and now work with many more systems. In
	   particular, Debian Sid, Debian 6.0 (Squeeze), Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty), Ubuntu
	   10.04 (Lucid), Fedora 15, FreeBSD 8.2 and Cygwin have all been confirmed as
	   working.

	 - The old version required Ncurses to be present even when linking with
	   NcursesW. This has been fixed.

	 - Multiple header filenames are checked for each library as these seem to be
	   different in every system. The old version did not do these checks and hence
	   failed on many systems (eg, FreeBSD and Cygwin).

	 - A number of feature checks have been added: X/Open Enhanced functionality
	   checks, colour function checks, obsolete function checks, etc.

	 - The additional macros check for auxiliary libraries associated with Curses:
	   Panel, Menu and Form, again with checks against NcursesW, Ncurses and plain
	   Curses.

	 - Extensive documentation has been added, particularly useful for the beginner
	   (ie, exactly what needs to be put where for a working Curses check).

2011-07-17  Peter Simons  <simons@cryp.to>

	Fixed minor spelling errors detected by gnulib's QA module.

	AX_BOOST_FILESYSTEM: fixed cut-and-paste error

	AX_COMPILER_VENDOR: Make the list of vendors and corresponding symbols clearer
	Also deprecate the macros AX_CHECK_SUNPRO_C and AX_LANG_COMPILER_MS in favor
	of the more generic AX_COMPILER_VENDOR.

	ax_append_flag: Split file into one macro per file

2011-06-30  Nick Bowler  <nbowler@elliptictech.com>

	ax_check_openssl: Fix underquoted macro arguments.
	Several of the macros used in AX_CHECK_OPENSSL have underquoted
	arguments.  In particular, autoconf complains loudly about the
	unquoted AC_LANG_PROGRAM argument to AC_LINK_IFELSE:

	  configure.ac:10: warning: AC_LANG_CONFTEST: no AC_LANG_SOURCE call detected in body
	  ../../lib/autoconf/lang.m4:194: AC_LANG_CONFTEST is expanded from...
	  ../../lib/autoconf/general.m4:2662: _AC_LINK_IFELSE is expanded from...
	  ../../lib/autoconf/general.m4:2679: AC_LINK_IFELSE is expanded from...
	  m4/ax_check_openssl.m4:38: AX_CHECK_OPENSSL is expanded from...
	  configure.ac:10: the top level

	Fix that up, and fix up the others while we're at it.

2011-06-28  Anders Kaseorg  <andersk@mit.edu>

	AX_CHECK_FLAG: Fix to work with autoconf 2.59
	• AS_VAR_PUSHDEF([FLAGS], [something containing FLAGS]) caused an
	  infinite loop before v2.65~21.
	• AS_VAR_APPEND was new in v2.63b~224.
	• AS_VAR_IF was new in v2.63~27.
	• AS_ECHO was new in AUTOCONF-2.61a~45, and AC_PROG_GREP in
	  AUTOCONF-2.59c~744, but their use here is more idiomatically
	  replaced with a case pattern anyway.
	• Before AUTOCONF-2.60b~8, the variable name passed to AC_CACHE_CHECK,
	  AS_VAR_GET, AS_VAR_SET, and AS_VAR_SET_IF must be left unquoted.

2011-06-25  Peter Simons  <simons@cryp.to>

	AX_CFLAGS_GCC_OPTION: deprecated in favor of AX_CHECK_COMPILE_FLAG

	Added a proper 'obsolete' section to AX_C_CHECK_FLAG, AX_CHECK_LINKER_FLAGS, AX_CPP_CHECK_FLAG, AX_CXX_CHECK_FLAG, AX_CXXCPP_CHECK_FLAG, and AX_LD_CHECK_FLAG.

	Bumped serial numbers of AX_CFLAGS_*_OPTION, AX_CHECK_{COMPILER,LINKER}_FLAGS, and edited the formatting of the documentation for consistency. Also documented the recent changes in the NEWS file.

2011-06-25  Maarten Bosmans  <mkbosmans@gmail.com>

	Implement AX_*_CHECK_FLAG on top of ax_check_flag.m4 macros
	The PROLOGUE and BODY arguments were almost never used, so there's no need to
	keep them. Just emit a warning if they are nonempty.

	Implement AX_CHECK_*_FLAGS on top of ax_check_flag.m4 macros
	The implementation takes care to empty the CFLAGS, to mimic previous behaviour,
	but the new behaviour of AX_CHECK_COMPILE_FLAG should be better for most situations.

	ax_cflags_*_option.m4: Use AX_APPEND_FLAG macro to append the flag

	ax_cflags_*_option.m4: Use AX_CHECK_COMPILE_FLAG macro to do most of the work
	This gets rid of the for loop and the string splitting using sed.  For
	gcc_option the logic is now contained in a much easier to follow if statement.

	Add ax_check_flag.m4

	ax_cflags_*_option.m4: Consolidate CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS macros
	Combine duplicate AX_CFLAGS_ and AX_CXXFLAGS_ macros into one AX_FLAGS macro and
	change language in the language_specific macro.

	ax_cflags_*_option.m4: Consolidate _OLD and _NEW macros
	Combine duplicate _OLD and _NEW macros into one _PRIVATE macro and switch
	arguments in the main macro.

	AX_CHECK_MYSQL: new submission
	I am submitting an Autoconf Macro I've been developing for the past
	couple months - ax_check_mysql.m4. I'm aware that multiple other MySQL
	macros exist, but mine is specifically geared toward MySQL plugin
	development and installation. Specifically:

	 - Automatically Detects binary, include, and plugin directories for most
	   typical MySQL installations.

	 - Provides methods for one to designate the directories manually, or point to
	   a root directory containing a MySQL installation.

	See <http://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?7553> for further details.

	AX_CHECK_DEFINE: various bug fixes
	 - Change macro names to CHECK_DEFINE and alias the old name CHECK_DEFINED.
	   This makes the names in sync with the help comments on top.

	 - Update obsolete AC_TRY_COMPILE to AC_COMPILE_IFELSE.

	 - Include header name in cache value and in output message.

	 - Switch #ifndef to #ifdef. That macro could not have worked previously.

	AX_BOOST_THREAD: fixes two bugs that prevented cross-compilation for Windows on Unix
	 - In the OS selection switches, where the special cases for mingw are
	   selected, it says ming32 but should be mingw32.

	 - Those switches are supposed to be dependent on the os you compile for but
	   the switch uses the build_os variable.

2011-04-01  Peter Simons  <simons@cryp.to>

	AX_HAVE_QT: libraries come last, not first
	The linker call in ax_have_qt.m4 names libraries before the objects.
	This will fail when --as-needed is in effect. This patch moves the

2011-03-17  Peter Simons  <simons@cryp.to>

	AX_PATH_GENERIC has been extended to allow setting LIBRARY_LIBS and LIBRARY_CFLAGS variables on configure command line or in the environment to override the normal values returned by `library-config --libs` and `--cflags` respectively. See <http://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?7490> for further details.

	AX_LIB_EXPAT: store found library in EXPAT_LIBS instead if EXPAT_LDFLAGS
	This change is necessary to avoid build failures when linking with --as-needed.
	See <http://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?7489> for further details.

	AX_WITH_PROG, AX_WITH_CURSES: synchronize serial numbers with Git

	AX_WITH_PROG, AX_WITH_CURSES: pseudo-bump #serial number
	These macros have serial numbers greater than the number of commits that
	modified them. Since we cannot decrease serial numbers once they've been
	assigned, the macros need two (effectively empty) commits to synchronize
	their serial number with Git.

2011-03-17  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	AX_PKG_SWIG: fix the configure check so it can find swig 2 as swig2.0
	Ubuntu Maverick and Ubuntu Natty install swig 2 as /usr/bin/swig2.0
	because they do not yet want to upgrade their normal swig package. This
	lets our macro find that too.

2011-03-13  Reuben Thomas  <rrt@sc3d.org>

	Use && not -a in tests.

	Quote first argument of AC_DEFINE.

	AX_LUA: normalize formatting of the documentation

2011-02-26  Reuben Thomas  <rrt@sc3d.org>

	Add AX_PROG_LUA macro, and improve behaviour of single version number given to mean “exactly this version” rather than “this verison or greater”.

	Add Lua 5.2 support (trivial!).
	Remove --with-lua-prefix (use CPPFLAGS &c. instead).

2011-02-06  Mike Frysinger  <vapier@gentoo.org>

	AX_CREATE_PKGCONFIG_INFO: don't add user CPPFLAGS/LDFLAGS to pc files
	CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS are settings that come from the user.  These
	should not be placed into .pc files.  Since this helper already
	provides variables for getting cflags/ldflags into the .pc file,
	just punt the user sourcing.

2010-11-11  Rhys Ulerich  <rhys.ulerich@gmail.com>

	Move AX_CXX_{CPP,CXX,LD}FLAGS_STD_LANG to AX_COMPILER_VENDOR
	Nested quoting within AX_CXX_COMPILER_VENDOR gives warnings on

	ax_lib_hdf5: improve {C,CPP,LD,F}FLAGS + Fortran
	Newer compiler wrapper versions stop providing as

	in the compiler wrapper's -show output.

	This greatly improves HDF5_FFLAGS.  Also, added HDF5_FLIBS

	AX_PREFIX_CONFIG_H: added support for system shell "dash"
	The AX_PREFIX_CONFIG_H macro doesn't work with dash, the bug is already
	noted in the source file. As of autoconf 2.62, AS_ECHO can be used to
	print strings that may contain backslashes or look like options. This
	patch updates AX_PREFIX_CONFIG_H to use it.

	The comment in the source file refers to $ECHO from libtool, but this
	requires libtool.m4 which is not part of autoconf, and AS_ECHO is. On
	the other hand, libtool.m4 (at least the one on my system) only requires
	autoconf 2.58 or higher, so depending on how much you value
	compatibility with older autoconf versions, that may be a better choice.

	See <http://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?7317> for further details.

	AX_CFLAGS_GCC_OPTION: use AS_VAR_COPY() if available, but don't require it
	Peter Kjellerstedt noticed a problem when using the updated macro with an older

	relatively new addition to the API, and did not exist in 2.61.

	AX_PTHREAD: fix compiler warning in AC_TRY_LINK test program
	The test program generated by AX_PTHREAD's AC_TRY_LINK invocation generates a
	compiler warning (on Linux, using GCC 4). When building with "-Wall -Werror" in
	CFLAGS, as done during development to catch unexpected warnings, this turns
	into a compiler error; hence, all of the AC_TRY_LINK invocations fail, and the
	macro fails to detect any suitable compiler/linker flags for pthreads usage.

	A sample from config.log showing the error follows.

	  configure:16038: result: no
	  configure:15936: checking whether pthreads work without any flags
	  configure:16029: gcc -o conftest -O3 -g -Wall -Werror -pipe -fvisibility=hidden -Wl,-O1 -Wl,--as-needed conftest.c >&5
	  cc1: warnings being treated as errors
	  conftest.c: In function 'main':
	  conftest.c:31: error: 'th' is used uninitialized in this function

	This patch fixes the issue by placing pthread_create before pthread_join in the
	test program.

2009-12-25  Neil Mayhew  <neil_mayhew@users.sourceforge.net>

	AX_CHECK_ICU: added support for icu-specific CPPFLAGS
	This macro uses the icu-config utility which treats CPPFLAGS separately
	from CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS. Clients should be able to obtain the value of
	CPPFLAGS, which is not currently possible. This patch fixes that.

	Note that this behavior is slightly different from PKG_CHECK_MODULES,
	since the underlying pkg-config doesn't distinguish between CFLAGS and
	CPPFLAGS. Using CFLAGS instead of CPPFLAGS with icu-config leads to
	problems, such as header files not found, and compilation errors since
	icu has its own slightly quirky ideas about what kind of strict warnings
	should be used, even though these are not required for using the ICU
	headers.

	Clients should typically use ICU_CPPFLAGS rather than ICU_CFLAGS or
	ICU_CXXFLAGS if they just want to be able to find headers.

	AX_C_IFDEF: deprecated in favor of the standard Autoconf macro AC_CHECK_DECL

	AX_CXX_HELPFUL_TERMINATE_HANDLER: initial version
	Submitted by Kevin Locke in <https://savannah.nongnu.org/patch/index.php?7005>:

	 | As a compliment (or possibly replacement) to the current
	 | AX_CXX_VERBOSE_TERMINATE_HANDLER macro, I present the
	 | AX_CXX_HELPFUL_TERMINATE_HANDLER macro. Rather than specifically looking for
	 | the GNU libstdc++ verbose_terminate_handler, this macro uses a test program
	 | which throws an uncaught exception then checks if the output contains
	 | information about the exception. This way it can detect helpful terminate
	 | handlers other than the current one provided with GNU libstdc++.
	 |
	 | The design of this macro is not perfect. Most importantly, the logic for
	 | capturing and testing the output of the test program is not very elegant. I
	 | had first attempted to check for output from within the test program (by
	 | redirecting std::cerr, capturing SIGABRT, etc.) but it was excessively ugly
	 | and not very portable. The result is that the logic in the macro itself is a
	 | little more awkward so that the test program is trivial. I think it was a
	 | good trade, but feedback is welcome.

	AX_LATEX_*: marked obsolete because of issues with LGPL license
	The AX_LATEX_* family of macros is distributed under the LPGL license.
	Use of that license is discouraged for Autoconf macros, because it might
	impose licensing restrictions on the generated configure script. All
	other macros in the Archive that are licensed under LGPL or GPL feature
	an explicit Autoconf Exception that lifts those limitations, but the
	LaTeX macros did not. Unfortunately, all attempts to contact the author
	with a request to remedy the situation have been been unsuccessful.

	Dropped obsolete macros from the repository.
	These macros have been replaced by newer versions and are no longer required.
	Where applicable, the newer versions feature an AU_ALIAS() forwarder that
	redirects invocations of the obsolete macro to the current one.

	it's uncertain whether that usage of AU_ALIAS actually works as intended. In

	AX_DIST_RPM: Do not break VPATH builds
	AX_DIST_RPM was breaking VPATH builds since it was expecting the spec
	template to be in the build directory during configure time.  Obviously
	this breaks distcheck which checks, among other things, VPATH builds.

	AX_DIST_RPM: Do not hard code the spec template
	The spec template was hard coded in and the macro was ignoring the
	template given by the caller.

	AX_DIST_RPM: Remove use of @NAME@ and @VER@.
	It appears that at one point the previously values were being
	substituted in at make time but this is no longer the case.  Modify the

	AX_CVS,AX_DIST_MSI: Rewritten to use AX_ADD_AM_MACRO_STATIC.
	These changes have not been tested very well since I don't have the software

	to use GNU Make syntax which will cause Automake to complain unless portability
	warnings are disabled.

	Please feel free to modify this patch and commit message as necessary.

2009-04-20  Allan Caffee  <allan.caffee@gmail.com>

	AX_DIST_RPM (and dependent macros) Modified to use AX_ADD_AM_MACRO_STATIC.
	The macros AX_UPLOAD, AX_INSTALL_FILES, and AX_EXTRA_DIST which are often used
	in conjunction with AX_DIST_RPM were also updated to use
	AX_ADD_AM_MACRO_STATIC.

	Thanks go to Ralf Wildenhues for the idea of adding local cleanup and
	distribution targets as prerequisites the *-local/*-hook targets.

2009-04-20  Allan Caffee  <allan.caffee@gmail.com>

	AX_ADD_AM_MACRO_STATIC: Added a new macro and helpers.
	This new macro adds some text to the file aminclude_static.am when *Autoconf*
	is run.  The current macro AX_ADD_AM_MACRO writes text to the file
	`aminclude.am' when _configure_ is run.  Unfortunately this means that a) the
	existing macro append Make code rather than Automake code as the name would
	imply and b) only works for implementations of Make which allow includes, BSD
	Make and GNU Make are the only ones that come to mind.

	Hopefully this new macro will eventually replace the existing one altogether
	because it allows Automake to do the actual work thereby offering more portable
	Makefiles and pushing logic out of configure conditionals and into
	AM_CONDITIONALs.  However, in an attempt to avoid breaking existing Autoconf
	scripts those macros have been left unchanged for the time being.

2009-04-19  Peter Simons  <simons@cryp.to>

	AUTHORS: updated after recent changes to AX_ENABLE_BUILDDIR

2009-04-19  Alan Jenkins  <alan-jenkins@tuffmail.co.uk>

	AX_ENABLE_BUILDDIR: Add support for "dist-bzip2" target and friends
	We already get a special toplevel Makefile rule for "dist", which
	copies the tarball from the build directory to the source directory.

	Many projects publish tarballs compressed using Bzip2 to save a bit
	more bandwidth.  Automake provides a "dist-bzip2" rule for this
	purpose, and many others for different compression methods.
	Unfortunately the rules don't all match the file extensions (dist-bzip
	makes .bz2).  So for dist-foo rules, just copy *all* the tarballs.
	Ugly, but useful.

2009-04-19  Alan Jenkins  <alan-jenkins@tuffmail.co.uk>

	AX_ENABLE_BUILDDIR: Fix "make distclean" toplevel Makefile target
	$ ./configure; make
	...
	MAKE i686-pc-linux-gnu : 0 * distclean
	make[1]: Entering directory `/home/alan/bootup/src/module-init-tools/build'
	rm -f doc/*.tmp manpage.refs manpage.links
	make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/alan/bootup/src/module-init-tools/build'
	MAKE i686-pc-linux-gnu : 0 * distclean (all local builds)
	# rm -r .
	# (sleep 3)
	rm -r .
	rm: cannot remove directory `.'

	The problem is the method used to determine which builddirs are local,
	and therefore should removed by "make distclean".  It relies on them
	starting with "./", but they don't :-).  Instead, we can assume that
	non-local directories will start with "/" or "../".

2009-04-19  Alan Jenkins  <alan-jenkins@tuffmail.co.uk>

	AX_ENABLE_BUILDDIR: Prevent multiple dist-all targets in top-level Makefile
	$ ./configure; make
	...
	Makefile:852: target `dist-all' given more than once in the same rule.

	The macro generates additional X-all targets, meaning "make target X in
	all build directories".  My source Makefile includes a rule like this:

	    dist dist-all: ...

	It gets converted to

	    dist dist-all dist-all:

	When what we really want is this

	    dist dist-all:

2009-04-19  Alan Jenkins  <alan-jenkins@tuffmail.co.uk>

	AX_ENABLE_BUILDDIR: Fix ":=" assignments in top-level generated Makefile
	The sed script which generates the top-level Makefile from the Makefile
	in the build directory is flawed.  It treats an assignment of the form
	"TESTSUITE := ..." as a makefile rule - because it contains ":".

	$ make
	...
	MAKE  : 1 * TESTSUITE
	make[1]: Entering directory `/home/alan/bootup/src/module-init-tools/build'
	make[1]: *** No rule to make target `TESTSUITE'.  Stop.

	Fix the sed script to skip the rule-related commands for lines which
	contain ":=".  As a cleanup, we can also skip the rule-related commands
	for lines which do not contain ":".  That simplifies those commands,
	because they don't need to test for ":" themselves.

2009-04-19  Alan Jenkins  <alan-jenkins@tuffmail.co.uk>

	AX_ENABLE_BUILDDIR: Fix builds configured from a subdirectory
	I would like to be able to bypass ENABLE_BUILDDIR and configure a
	subdirectory myself, without generating a toplevel Makefile.
	(This is for an unusual automated testsuite which tests behaviour
	with different configure options, and compiles with -DJUST_TESTING
	to build a testable version of the program).

	$ mkdir build; cd build; ../configure
	...
	config.status: executing buildir commands
	config.status: create top_srcdir/Makefile guessed from local Makefile
	config.status: build in yes (HOST=)
	...
	$ cd ..; make
	MAKE i686-pc-linux-gnu : 0 * all-all
	/bin/bash: line 9: cd: yes: No such file or directory
	make: *** [all-all] Error 1

	Also:
	./configure --disable-builddir
	...
	config.status: executing buildir commands
	config.status: keeping top_srcdir/Makefile from earlier configure
	...

	Which should really be:

	config.status: executing buildir commands
	config.status: leaving top_srcdir/Makefile untouched

2009-04-19  Alan Jenkins  <alan-jenkins@tuffmail.co.uk>

	AX_ENABLE_BUILDDIR: Fix path for config.guess
	Using this macro, I get a warning that config.guess can't be found.
	It doesn't cause a problem for me because I'm not cross-compiling
	for multiple hosts, but it is annoying.

		$ ./configure
		...
		$ make
		sh: Can't open ../config.guess
		...

	Reason: ".." is "$AUX".
	The top-level makefile is generated *after* the configure script reruns
	itself in the build directory.  At that point, AUX is equal to "..".

	Solution: use AM_AUX_DIR_EXPAND to generate an absolute version of
	ac_aux_dir.

	AX_BOOST_{THREAD,PROGRAM_OPTIONS}: replace non-portable shell constructs

	AX_C99_INLINE: initial version
	The macro determines whether the "inline" keyword of a C99 compiler is
	standards compliant or not.  I am using this macro support differences
	between gcc 4.2 (and earlier) and gcc 4.3 (and later) when using the
	"-std= c99" option.  It may also be useful for other compilers.  (For
	details of the differences between the compiler versions refer to
	http:// gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.3/porting_to.html "Sematic change of extern
	inline")

	Example configure.ac:

	  AC_INIT([foo], [0.1])
	  AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE

	  AC_PROG_CC
	  AC_PROG_CC_C99
	  if test "$ac_cv_prog_cc_c99" == "no"; then

	  #else
	  static inline int myFunction(int a) { return a + 1; }

	AC_SET_VERSIONLEVEL: obsolete macro
	This macro appears to be broken. Any attempt to use, i.e.

	  AC_SET_VERSIONLEVEL([foo], [1.1.1])

	results in an error message: "m4_popdef: undefined macro: foo_MICRO". If
	someone knows how to fix this problem, please let me know.

2008-04-28  Peter Simons  <simons@cryp.to>

	AX_SET_VERSION_INFO: obsolete macro
	To the best of my understanding, this macro is based on a misconception
	about Libtool's -version-info flag.

	Apparently, the macro invocation AX_SET_VERSION_INFO([2.4.18]) is
	transformed into "-release 2" and "-version-info 4:18". However, those
	two flags contradict each other. The -release option specifies a version
	number in the sense that we all know and love, but -version-info does
	not: that flag implements a fairly sophisticated scheme meant to express
	binary interface compatibility which is supposed to *replace* -release
	versions. Deriving settings for both of those flags from one number
	doesn't make sense.

	See "6.2 Libtool's versioning system" for further details.

	..., for inclusion in the archive.

2008-04-12  Peter Simons  <simons@cryp.to>

	ALL: updated m4 distribution format
	The markup format distributed by the Autoconf Macro Archive underwent
	the following changes:

	 * All archive entries use '#' comment delimiters, rather than 'dnl',
	   because we would like those comments to go into the generated
	   configure script. It should be simple for everyone to determine
	   where the macro came from originally, who wrote it, and where the
	   latest version can be retrieved. To achieve this, every macro used
	   to start with a distinguished line that shows the URL of its
	   respective home page, i.e.:

	   | ##### http://autoconf-archive.cryp.to/ax_prog_acme.html

	   As it happens, the aclocal utility distributed with Automake
	   ignores all comment lines that start with a double hash '##', thus
	   those home page URLs will not make it into any automatically
	   generated aclocal.m4 file. Duh. To remedy the situation, the
	   following markup is now used instead:

	   | # =================================================================
	   | #        http://autoconf-archive.cryp.to/ax_prog_acme.html
	   | # =================================================================

	 * The 2.x versions of the GNU GPL and LGPL contain the following
	   clause:

	   | You should have received a copy of the <GNU LICENSE NAME> along
	   | with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation,
	   | Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA.

	   Version 3.x, however, smartly refers the reader to the Web:

	   | You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
	   | along with this program. If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

	   This patch changes all GPL2 and LGPL2 macros to do the same, i.e.
	   to refer to the GNU web site for the full text of the respective
	   license.

	 * Since all m4 files had to be changed in this commit anyway, the
	   opportunity was used to increase the auto-fill column for
	   documentation from 65 to 75 characters per line. It's a trivial
	   change, but it just looks nicer.

2008-01-28  Francesco Salvestrini  <salvestrini@gmail.com>

	Major re-factoring of Perl, Guile, Python, and Ruby detection macros.
	The new submission AX_WITH_PROG generalizes the technique employed by the
	original AX_WITH_PYTHON to allow for detecting generic executables. Based on
	that macro, trivial wrappers are provided for finding installed versions of
	Perl, Guile, Python, and Ruby.

	NOTE: The earlier version of AX_WITH_PYTHON performed a version check. The
	AX_WITH_PROG-based macros don't do that. Instead, separate macros are available
	for Perl, Guile, Python, and Ruby that check the version of a given executable
	in a second, independent step.

2007-08-21  Peter Simons  <simons@cryp.to>

	AX_ENABLE_BUILDDIR: Revert renaming of variable HOST to BUILD.
	Further discussion on the Autoconf mailing list has reached the
	following consensus: although BUILD is the right choice in most
	cases, in case of cross-compilation it is not. Cross-compilation
	needs HOST to be set, so the original version of this macro is
	the safer choice. This patch reverts commit
	41da8f494cd209a9836ebeae8f211cb84dde9153.

	An unpleasant property of HOST is that most shell environments
	define that variable to the local hostname. When configure uses
	$HOST as a default setting, however, that is not what it expects
	to find -- HOST is supposed to be config.guess tripple. Thus, the
	user is forced to specify HOST explicitly or to undefine $HOST in
	the shell before calling configure. That's a bit of mess. Bright
	ideas and patches are welcome.

	AX_COMPILER_VENDOR: added support for Pathscale compiler

2007-08-09  Julian Cummings  <cummings@cacr.caltech.edu>

	AX_F90_MODULE_FLAG: drop support for -module flag
	It turns out that in Version 3.0 of the Pathscale Fortran
	compiler they have "clarified" the meaning of the -module flag to
	only be for setting the directory where *.mod files are written.
	In version 3.0, you can only use -module once in a command line,
	and if you use it, then the compiler will look there first for
	module files to be read before looking in the -I directories.
	Thus, it really is best to just use the -I flag here and let the
	user add one specific -module option only if they want or need to
	redirect module output files.

	This commit reverts 5ba234dd8f69456238e7718d4f3a7c116639e373.

	AX_F90_MODULE_FLAG: support -module PGI compiler flag
	I have "-module " to the list of compiler options that is tried
	in order to support the PGI Fortran compiler. Without this
	change, the PGI compiler actually accepts "-I" and passes the
	test. However, this option is actually meant for setting the
	include file search path to find files that are included with the
	Fortran INCLUDE statement. Although the -I flag works in this
	case because there are no -module options on the command line,
	things will not work correctly if the user does bring in the
	-module option on the actual compile command line.

	AX_ENABLE_BUILDDIR: Renamed variable HOST to BUILD.
	The patch universally replaces "host" with "build" and "HOST"
	with "BUILD". The rationale is that typically the user wishes to
	segregate builds based upon the BUILD target rather than the
	configuration HOST type. Now that these host and build variables
	are treated as more fully distinct in Autoconf, it makes sense to
	honor this distinction.

	ax_boost*.m4: Portability improvements.
	Joerg Sonnenberger reported a problem:

	 | This fails on a number of systems because in
	 |
	 |     AC_CHECK_LIB($ax_lib, main, [BOOST_REGEX_LIB=$ax_lib break])
	 |
	 | the BOOST_REGEX_LIB a local variable for break. Can you fix
	 | that macro to use two statements? Try running this with bash3
	 | in native mode for example.
