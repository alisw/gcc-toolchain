@majorheading Synopsis

@smallexample
AX_COMPILER_VENDOR
@end smallexample

@majorheading Description

Determine the vendor of the C, C++ or Fortran compiler.  The vendor is
returned in the cache variable $ax_cv_c_compiler_vendor for C,
$ax_cv_cxx_compiler_vendor for C++ or $ax_cv_fc_compiler_vendor for
(modern) Fortran.  The value is one of "intel", "ibm", "pathscale",
"clang" (LLVM), "cray", "fujitsu", "sdcc", "sx", "nvhpc" (NVIDIA HPC
Compiler), "portland" (PGI), "gnu" (GCC), "sun" (Oracle Developer
Studio), "hp", "dec", "borland", "comeau", "kai", "lcc", "sgi",
"microsoft", "metrowerks", "watcom", "tcc" (Tiny CC) or "unknown" (if
the compiler cannot be determined).

To check for a Fortran compiler, you must first call AC_FC_PP_SRCEXT
with an appropriate preprocessor-enabled extension.  For example:

@smallexample
  AC_LANG_PUSH([Fortran])
  AC_PROG_FC
  AC_FC_PP_SRCEXT([F])
  AX_COMPILER_VENDOR
  AC_LANG_POP([Fortran])
@end smallexample
