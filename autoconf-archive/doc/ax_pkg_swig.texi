@majorheading Synopsis

@smallexample
AX_PKG_SWIG([major.minor.micro], [action-if-found], [action-if-not-found])
@end smallexample

@majorheading Description

This macro searches for a SWIG installation on your system. If found,
then SWIG is AC_SUBST'd; if not found, then $SWIG is empty.  If SWIG is
found, then SWIG_LIB is set to the SWIG library path, and AC_SUBST'd.

You can use the optional first argument to check if the version of the
available SWIG is greater than or equal to the value of the argument. It
should have the format: N[.N[.N]] (N is a number between 0 and 999. Only
the first N is mandatory.) If the version argument is given (e.g.
1.3.17), AX_PKG_SWIG checks that the swig package is this version number
or higher.

As usual, action-if-found is executed if SWIG is found, otherwise
action-if-not-found is executed.

In configure.in, use as:

@smallexample
  AX_PKG_SWIG(1.3.17, [], [ AC_MSG_ERROR([SWIG is required to build..]) ])
  AX_SWIG_ENABLE_CXX
  AX_SWIG_MULTI_MODULE_SUPPORT
  AX_SWIG_PYTHON
@end smallexample
