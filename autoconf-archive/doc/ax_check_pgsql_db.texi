@majorheading Synopsis

@smallexample
AX_CHECK_PGSQL_DB([DB], [USER], [HOST], [PASSWORD], [ACTION_IF_FAILED], [ACTION_IF_OK])
@end smallexample

@majorheading Description

This macro checks whether we can connect to a PostgreSQL server with the
given data. The macro AX_PROG_PGCLIENT is required by this one. The
variable $pgclient_call is set for later use in Makefiles, if you'd like
to make use of this, you must do

@smallexample
  AC_SUBST(pgclient_call)
@end smallexample

after having called AX_CHECK_PGSQL_DB. You can then do something like
the following in your Makefile.am:

@smallexample
  @@pgclient_call@@ -f file.sql
@end smallexample

If you want the user to set the data, you should support something like
these configure options:

@smallexample
  AC_ARG_WITH(pgsql-host,
          [  --with-pgsql-host=HOST               server is running on HOST @@<:@@local socket@@:>@@],
          [pg_host=$withval], [pg_host=])
@end smallexample

@smallexample
  AC_ARG_WITH(pgsql-db,
          [  --with-pgsql-db=DATABASE             use DATABASE @@<:@@tarantoola@@:>@@],
          [pg_db=$withval], [pg_db=tarantoola])
@end smallexample

@smallexample
  AC_ARG_WITH(pgsql-user,
          [  --with-pgsql-user=USER               use USER @@<:@@postgres@@:>@@],
          [pg_user=$withval], [pg_user=postgres])
@end smallexample

@smallexample
  AC_ARG_WITH(pgsql-password,
          [  --with-pgsql-password=PASSWORD       use PASSWORD @@<:@@none@@:>@@],
          [pg_password=$withval], [pg_password=""])
@end smallexample

You can then call the macro like this:

@smallexample
  AX_CHECK_PGSQL_DB([$pg_db], [$pg_user], [$pg_host], [$pg_password], [AC_MSG_ERROR([We need a database connection!])])
@end smallexample
