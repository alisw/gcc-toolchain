@majorheading Description

This macro does a complete Python development environment check.

It checks for all known versions. When it finds an executable, it looks
to find the header files and library.

It sets PYTHON_BIN to the name of the python executable,
PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR to the directory holding the header files, and
PYTHON_LIB to the name of the Python library.

This macro calls AC_SUBST on PYTHON_BIN (via AC_CHECK_PROG),
PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR and PYTHON_LIB.
