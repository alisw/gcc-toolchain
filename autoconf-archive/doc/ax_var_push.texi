@majorheading Synopsis

@smallexample
AX_VAR_PUSHVALUE(VARIABLE, [VALUE])
@end smallexample

@majorheading Description

Stores a copy of variable_name's value and assigns it to 'value' If no
value is given, its original value is kept. Compile, link and running
tests usually require the programmer to provide additional flags.
However, it is strongly recommended not to override flags defined by the
user through the configure command. AX_VAR_PUSHVALUE and AX_VAR_POPVALUE
are clean way to temporarily store a variable's value and restore it
later, using a stack-like behaviour. This macro supports nesting.

Example:

@smallexample
  AX_VAR_PUSHVALUE([CXXFLAGS],["my test flags"])
  perform some checks with CXXFLAGS...
  CXXFLAGS value will be "my test flags"
  AX_VAR_POPVALUE([CXXFLAGS])
  CXXFLAGS is restored to its original value
@end smallexample
