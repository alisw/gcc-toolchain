AX_TLS([action-if-found], [action-if-not-found])

@majorheading Description

Provides a test for the compiler support of thread local storage (TLS)
extensions. Defines TLS if it is found. Currently knows about C++11,
GCC/ICC, and MSVC. I think SunPro uses the same as GCC, and Borland
apparently supports either.
